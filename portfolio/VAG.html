                    The aim of this project was to conduct an analysis of the interactions within a real-world participant group and devise a technology solution to improve a particular process in a group of five. After trying to contact a dozen organizations, ultimately, my group decided to collaborate with the Vancouver Art Gallery for this project.

                As a team member, I took responsibility for sourcing appropriate persona images online and selecting typography for the posters. Based on the Vancouver Art Museum's style and color palette, I created nine different design options for the team's consideration.

                I took the lead in designing the layout for both maps. Drawing from examples provided by our teacher, I identified key elements that would be most effective for our project and shared my findings with the team. Together, we revised and refined the maps until we had a final product that accurately reflected the personas' experiences and interactions with the Vancouver Art Gallery.

                The project provided me with a complete experience of the design process, allowing me to identify my strengths and weaknesses in the field. Through this project, I was able to gain valuable insights into the entire process and practice each step. My learning from this project helped me to improve my design approach and equipped me with practical skills that are essential to my profession.Working with the Vancouver Art Gallery was a unique and invaluable experience. I learned how to communicate effectively with stakeholders, exchange ideas, understand their needs, present our design solutions, and obtain constructive feedback.Conducting interviews and designing online questionnaires for visitors was an excellent opportunity for me to enhance my research skills. I learned to avoid asking leading questions and developed strategies to gather core information within a limited timeframe. By organizing my questions in a better way, I was able to get the most out of my research.
